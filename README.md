# Eat Da Burger!
Build your own fantasy burger, then devour it (or at least the fantasy of it).

This simple web page allows you to enter the name of any burger you like, and will add it to the database for all of eternity. You can also "devour" any of the uneaten burgers you like by clicking on the button next to the name. Once eaten, the burger will move from the Uneaten to the Eaten list. One wishlist item for the future of this project is to add input fields for ingredients that each new burger contains.
